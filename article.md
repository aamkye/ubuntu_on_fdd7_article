# HomeLab: How DevOps manage information and maintain high availability of the home infrastructure

Get to know how DevOps compute, stores, preserves, presents, and plays with information and data but also maintains high availability of the home infrastructure using corporation-grade software and hardware

## Introduction

A long time ago, when I was only a kid, I had rather a good pc (as for those times) with a tremendous 80 GB of hard disk, powerful Intel Core 2 Duo, and 2 GB of RAM. I was very happy with it. I was able to play games, watch movies, listen to music, and do my homework and everything I wanted and needed.

But only for some time. Because after a couple of months, I discovered the world of the Internet - P2P, Linux, and unfortunately my library of favorite music started to grow very quickly. I realized that I needed more space. And because that was the time when harddisks were not so cheap - I had to have started deleting the stuff.

Nowadays I have a bookshelf of BluRays, a CD music collection, PS2 games, and books. And because I am a DevOps and "data enthusiast" - I have to have a good catalog of all of these things in a digital form to preserve it for future generations like my kids. I'm pretty sure they will love old PS2 games.

So today, two decades, I have no longer this issue of not having enough space, as I have built my own private HomeLab / NAS / Archive.org with rather small - roughly 96 TB raw space (as for these times) - but somehow it fits my things.

But let's start from the beginning.

## Types of HomeLabs and "Journey of their Owners"

### First start point
Every "data enthusiast" started his journey probably from this picture with this comment:

\- "Yeah, I have a bunch of external disks, literally everywhere. I need to move all this storage to one central place."

### Second start point

The second start point as an owner of HomeLab (typically more IT-Field related) is usually like this:

\- "Yeah, I have a bunch of Raspberry Pi. I have connected them to one Raspberry Pi cluster. How do I connect some storage to it?"

### "JBOPAN - Just Bunch of PCs and NASes" middle step

After combining the previous two pictures, we have a typical Reddit-like HomeLab that solves 90% of the problems:

\- "Yeah, I have a bunch of Raspberry Pi, a bunch of external disks, and a bunch of old laptops. I've connected it all with some TrueNAS under the hood. All my storage is under one SMB share. IT'S WORKING!"

### Small Rack

And this is the place where people usually ask themselves: "Is it enough for me?". Furtonetly, and most likely the typical answer is "no". And this is the place where the real HomeLab starts, where enthusiasts buy old (and sometimes new) server stuff and create magic with it saying:

\- "Yeah, that would do the work!"

### Big Rack time _(final HomeLab stage)_

But after some time, their HomeLab looks like this and they are posting on Reddit stuff like that:

\- "How do I quit? I have no more space for my HomeLab. I have to move to a bigger house."
