# HomeLab: How DevOps manage information and maintain high availability of the home infrastructure

Get to know how DevOps compute, stores, preserves, presents, and plays with information and data but also maintains high availability of the home infrastructure using corporation-grade software and hardware

## Introduction (Tale)

Once upon a time, back in the Stone Age of my childhood, I possessed a PC that was considered the bee's knees, at least in those ancient times. It boasted a whopping 80 gigabytes of hard disk space, an almighty Intel Core 2 Duo, and a mind-blowing 2 gigabytes of RAM. Oh, the joy it brought me! I could frolic in the virtual realms of games, bask in the glow of movies, groove to my favorite tunes, and conquer the daunting realm of homework.

But alas, this blissful existence was not meant to last. After a few months, I stumbled upon the mystical realm of the Internet—P2P, Linux, and all that jazz. As fate would have it, my music library started multiplying faster than gremlins in a swimming pool. It dawned on me that I desperately needed more space. Ah, the dark ages of hard disk scarcity, when they cost a fortune! I was left with no choice but to embark on a ruthless mission of deletion.

Fast forward to the present day, where I now possess a bookshelf adorned with BluRays, a vast collection of CDs, an arsenal of PS2 games, and more books than a library. As a self-proclaimed DevOps maestro and "data enthusiast," I felt obligated to digitize and preserve all these treasures for future generations—especially my own spawn. I have a sneaking suspicion that my kids will go bonkers for those ancient PS2 games.

And lo and behold, after two decades of technological advancement, I no longer suffer from the "not enough space" syndrome. Behold, my private HomeLab/NAS/Archive.org hybrid, lovingly crafted to house my hoard of goodies. It may not be the size of a small planet, but its humble 96 terabytes of raw space (considered puny by today's standards) somehow manages to accommodate my vast collection.

But enough reminiscing, let us venture back to where it all began, where my tale unfolds like a nostalgic Windows 95 screensaver.

## Tales of HomeLabs and the Adventures of their Owners (as I see it)

### The First Step of the Journey
Every self-proclaimed "data enthusiast" embarks on their grand adventure with a humble image and a relatable comment:

\- "Look at this chaos! External disks scattered everywhere. I must gather all this storage into one central haven."

### The Second Start of Progress

For those who venture further into the realm of HomeLabs, especially the tech-savvy bunch, their journey takes a different turn:

\- "Behold my Raspberry Pi army, united in a glorious cluster. But how do I bestow upon them the gift of storage?"

### The "JBOA - Just Bunch of Everything" Interlude

Merge the previous images, and witness the birth of a typical Reddit-esque HomeLab, providing solutions to 90% of their troubles:

\- "See here! Raspberry Pi, NAS devices, external disks, old PCs, and old laptops, all linked together by the almighty TrueNAS-ish software. My storage now thrives under a unified SMB share. It's a triumph!"

### "The Dawn of the Small Rack"

Yet, in this tale, a crucial question arises: "Is this enough for me?" Alas, the answer tends to be a resounding "no." Thus begins the true HomeLab, where enthusiasts acquire old (and sometimes new) server relics, and wield their magical powers:

\- "This shall suffice! Let the enchantment begin!"

### The Era of the Grand Rack (The Final HomeLab Stage)

However, as time marches on, their HomeLab transforms into a behemoth, and desperate pleas echo through the halls of Reddit:

\- "How do I escape this labyrinth? My HomeLab has consumed all available space. I must find a larger abode!"
